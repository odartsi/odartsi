## Hi, I’m Olympia 👋👩‍🔬

I’m a **physicist turned data scientist**, working at the intersection of  
**science, data, and interpretation**.

I enjoy building tools that turn **complex scientific data into clear insights** —  
often through **visualization, automation, and thoughtful analysis**.

### 🔬 What I care about
- Scientific rigor with practical impact  
- Making complicated ideas understandable  
- Interpretable models & transparent workflows  
- Combining **art, science, and data storytelling**

### 🎨 Beyond code
- Visualizations as a communication tool  
- Creative intersections between art & science  
- Cycling 🚴‍♀️ and mountain running 🏃‍♀️ fuel my thinking
